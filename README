--------------- WIN32 INSTALLER FOR MAKESTUFF BUILD ENVIRONMENT ----------------

This just simplifies the process of creating a desktop shortcut containing the
correct settings for PATH, MACHINE and HOSTTYPE, by allowing the user to choose
from the available C/C++ compilers, Python installations and Xilinx ISE
installations. It also writes a console record to the registry so the resulting
console has sensible defaults for size, font and other settings. It won't make
any attempt to actually install any software, but it will make suggestions and
provide download links for software it thinks the user should install.

Build it with an x86 MSVC compiler like this:

rc -nologo resource.rc; \
cl -O1 -Os -EHsc -D UNICODE -D _UNICODE -D _WIN32_IE=0x0500 -D WINVER=0x600 \
  -I. -Fesetup *.cpp kernel32.lib user32.lib ole32.lib shell32.lib \
  advapi32.lib comctl32.lib resource.res
